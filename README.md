# Data-Strutures-and-Algorithms-in-Java
A repository for documenting, studying and demonstrating various data structures and algorithms in Java.

As someone who believes that having a well-grounded understanding of data structures and algorithms is the 
quintessential trait of a good developer.  Therefore, I've set about documenting, studying and demonstrating
various data structures and algorithms in Java here in the hopes of learning them, internalizing them,
and appreciating them as much as possible over time.

While this undertaking is mostly for my own enjoyment and edification, I do hope that some day it will prove
valuable to other developers as a resource.
