# Data-Strutures-and-Algorithms-in-Java
A repository for documenting, studying and demonstrating various data structures and algorithms in Java.

I believe that having a well-grounded understanding of data structures and algorithms is the 
quintessential trait of a good developer.  Therefore, I've set about documenting, studying and demonstrating
various data structures and algorithms in Java here in the hopes of learning them, internalizing them,
and appreciating them as much as possible over time.

While this undertaking is mostly for my own enjoyment and edification, I do hope that some day it will prove
valuable to other developers as a resource.

Note that many of the algorithms and datastructures presented here are either directly copied with only slight
modifications (i.e. for reasons of style) from Robert Sedgewick's excellent Algorithms 4th edition text or are
else the outcome of working on exercises provided in the book.  Another powerful influence on the algorithms,
datastructures and applications thereof found here has been the incredible Introduction to Algorithms of
Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
